"I believe in programming until four in the morning in my pyjamas instead of getting up early to attend conferences about productivity. I believe in making the best possible products instead of launching just for the sake of it because some startup advice blog told me so. I believe in rational planning, logical consequences and bullshit-free hard work instead of “following my dreams”. In short, I believe in doing things."
By Ines Montani ( https://ines.io/ )

Code, code and code. Spend most of your time coding. If you are not being very efficient, if you are making mistakes in 90% of the time, do not worry, you are in good way. Just make sure to reduce 90% in 89% in the next week. Is just about time to be more efficient. And you and no one in the world will be 100% efficient. The knowledge is built from mistakes.

Be disciplined. There is no method to be 110% happy while you code for hours. Just do it. Eventually it will be more easier. Control your fear and your procrastination, but do not spend too much time trying to control. Just sit and code.

Try to explain what you are doing. Ask yourself how to describe a certain python object, how to iterate over it. Simulate a class having you as a teacher and try to explain word vectors and all structures that you will use in natural language processing. Check all methods and properties. Do not complete exercises without know what you are doing.
