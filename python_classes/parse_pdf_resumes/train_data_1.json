The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices. The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

Project Details UG PROJECT TITLE: Memory Bounded Anytime Heuristic Search A* Algorithm  This Project presents a heuristic-search algorithm called Memory-bounded Anytime Window A* (MAWA*), which is complete, anytime, and memory bounded. MAWA* uses the window-bounded anytime-search methodology of AWA* as the basic framework and combines it with the memory- bounded A* -like approach to handle restricted memory situations. Simple and efficient versions of MAWA* targeted for tree search have also been presented. Experimental results of the sliding-tile puzzle problem and the traveling-salesman problem show the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.

IP is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks  Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such as end-to-end security, quality of service (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 address space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing by border routers at network edges.  Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6 addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally, and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled  The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP addresses.

Defect filing in CDETS LANGUAGE TCL Programming, Python RELEASES LANCER, PHOENIX, SKYHAWK, SPRIT DESCRIPTION  Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the performance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network.  WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.  The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized  Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.
